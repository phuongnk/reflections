How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It shows what was changed between 2 versions

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Can easily undo a change, see what has been changed and undo if necessary
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
	Pros: Will not have too many unwanted versions
	Cons: Author may forget to commit
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	For some kind of work, one meaningful change usually involve changing multiple files
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	"git log" to list the versions, with version ID, date&time saved, and a message (description of the change)
	"git diff <versionId1> <versionId2>" to show the differences between the two versions
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	I can go back to a previous version and/or compare versions to quickly find out where the changes are, and from that info, knowing what causes the error.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
	Test with the repository downloaded
