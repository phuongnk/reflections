What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Git makes the current directory a Git repository by creating a subfolder named .git with metadata in it.
	Without initializing, a directory is not a Git repository and it's contents can't be versioned.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area contains the (information about the) files that will be tracked by Git.
	Working directory contains all the files, both tracked and un-tracked.
	Staging area allows to work with (choose, change, add, remove) files before committing, without the need to do multiple commits.
	
This line is added to this file after the file has been added to Git staging area using "git add"
